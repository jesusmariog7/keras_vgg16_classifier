# keras_vgg16_classifier
 In this notebook, an image classifier using the VGG16 pre-trained model is created to detect if images of concrete are cracked or not. This is acomplished by changing the output layer of th model and train the parameters with a specific dataset.
 
Steps:
 1) Build and train model using VGG16 pre-trained model
 2) Evaluate new model
 3) Test model on new data
